# K-Means Clustering Algorithm From Scratch using R Programming Language
K-Means Clustering code from scratch using R programming language.

## Required Packages
`ggplot` (for plotting the clustering result in each iteration)

## Dataset
There are 2 sample dataset in this project, they are [dataset 1](https://github.com/liemwellys/K-Means-R-FromScratch/blob/master/test1_data.txt) and [dataset 2](https://github.com/liemwellys/K-Means-R-FromScratch/blob/master/test2_data.txt).<br>
Each dataset consist of *N* rows data and 2 columns represent the *x*-axis and and *y*-axis.

## Running the code
The code is designed to cluster [dataset 2](https://github.com/liemwellys/K-Means-R-FromScratch/blob/master/test2_data.txt) into 3 clusters. If you want to change either dataset or the final number of clusters on another dataset samples, change the following parameters:<br>
<li>Dataset: line 5.
<li>Number of Clusters: line 10.
